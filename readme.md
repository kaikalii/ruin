# Description

Ruin is a programming language designed to be perfectly readable, writable, and runnable without a computer.

Modern computers are only made possible by an extremely complex network of infrastructure which involves everything 
from teams of software engineers to chip manufacturing to silicon refinement. When an apocalypse comes, this
infrastructure will collapse along with the rest of society. As software engineers, we don't want to become 
obsolete when some natural or man-made disaster destroys the delicate balance that allows our profession to exist. 
To this end, Ruin is designed to promote the creation of programs that are executable both before and after the end
of polite civilization. 

Ruin programs can be written in a text editor and run on a CPU. They can also be written in the radioactive dirt 
with a stick and executed with a bag of rocks.
